DualBootPatcher TravisCI build configuration


[Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) is free open-source continues integration service, which simply take your project from GitHub and test / build it for you!
It's amazing solution if you don't have time/free space to test your code.

* This script is building docker images, originally made by Mr. @[chenxiaolong](https://github.com/chenxiaolong) [here](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/DualBootPatcher/tree/master/docker) and upload them to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yshalsager/dualbootpatcher/)


What is [docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)? [in case you don't know it 😮 ]
> Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux, Windows Server, and Linux-on-mainframe apps.
